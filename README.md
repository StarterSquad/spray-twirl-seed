Spray + Twirl seed
==========

[Spray](http://Spray.io) is an extremely fast, lean and elegant http framework in Scala. Use it, it's awesome.

[Twirl](https://github.com/spray/twirl) is a port of the Play templating language to Spray. So now you can use Spray also for serving server side rendered html.

This seed project has the dependencies and plugins you'll likely need. Just update the project name in Build.scala.

Enjoy!
